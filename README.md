Project Title: Achievement Hub
Description:

Achievement Hub is a full-stack web application designed to streamline and digitize the process of managing, showcasing, and approving teachers’ academic and professional achievements within an educational institution.

The platform is built with a React (TypeScript) frontend for a modern, responsive user interface, and a Django + PostgreSQL backend ensuring robust authentication, real-time data management, and secure storage. The entire application maintains a red-and-white themed, intuitive UI with smooth animations, responsive layouts, and integrated feedback and reporting features.
